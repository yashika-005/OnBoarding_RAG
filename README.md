# OnBoarding RAG

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for HR policy question-answering, supporting multi-document search and interactive Q&A. This project helps organizations onboard new employees and answer HR-related queries efficiently using AI and document-based knowledge.

## Features
- **Multi-Document Q&A:** Handles questions across multiple HR policy documents (gratuity, leave, upskilling, etc.)
- **Intelligent Source Selection:** Automatically selects the most relevant document for each query
- **Streamlit Web Interface:** User-friendly UI for real-time Q&A and document uploads
- **Extensible Test Suite:** Easily add or modify test questions and documents
- **Source Attribution:** Shows which document provided each answer
